# Pool

### Why
- It feels like such a luxury to have a pool.
- Swimming in the summer is really nice, the whole family enjoys it.
- We currently have one of those set-up pools. This has no isolation and needs a ton of maintenance to keep the water clean.

### Description
For a 6x4x1.5m pool, you will need 36m続 of water. For pools of 40m続 a pump of 10m続/h is suggested. We are overdoing it with the 14m続/h pump, because we also want to push the water through either heating mats or some other construction on the roof.

When using a polystyreen pool, you build the frame of the pool of the isolation material. You build this on top of a concrete floor.

### Open questions
- [x] Which pump do we need?
- [x] How do we isolate the pool so no heat is lost on the soil?
- [x] Which size would be best?
- [ ] Can we pump swimming pool water through solar panels, to heat up the water and cool down the panels?
