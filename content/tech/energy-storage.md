# Energy storage

### Why
- During the day we produce more energy than we use and during the evening we use more than we produce.
- Power companies saying that we produce too much solar power for the power lines to handle.
- In the future energy companies will no longer pay enough for your energy, so your surplus will be less profitable (will no longer cancel out your usage).

### Cost

### Open questions
* [ ] Is it possible to control where power is coming from?
* [ ] How much capacity do we need?
* [ ] Chaining of batteries seems like a good idea, but can this be added on later?
* [ ] Where do you install the battery? Do you really want this in your basement?
