# My open source home

## Introduction
The idea of building a home has been in my mind for a couple of years now, but because of life and 'situations' we haven't had the chance to really get this off the ground.

Currently the housing market in The Netherlands is so tense that buying a piece of property is really hard. So while we are getting frustrated over that, I had the idea to put my ideas for our ideal home onto paper and also to find solutions for certain technical challenges there may be.

## The idea
While we want to be environment conscious, we also want to make sure the house feels warm, luxurious and modern. This means that the house should be isolated really well, loads of solar panels and pulling heat from either air or the earth.



### Example
For example, charging an electric car should use as much solar power as possible, but the following questions come to mind
- How do we make sure we charge with mostly solar energy?
- What if the washer and dryer are also running, the car should be told to slow down charging at that point.
- There should be an override, so in case of an early morning trip, that the car is fully charged.
- Should be usable for 'almost' everyone, also when you have no technical knowledge.

More and more of these ideas come to mind and I want to document those, not just for our own personal use, but also for other people to use.
