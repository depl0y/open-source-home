# Network

Currently I am using only [Ubiquiti](https://www.ui.com/) gear in my home network.

My current setup contains:
- [Unifi Secure Gateway](https://www.ui.com/unifi-routing/usg/)
- 4x [Unifi AC-PRO Access Point](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/)
- 2x [Unifi Switch Flex Mini](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/usw-flex-mini)

For my future plans I want all ethernet connections to be routed back to the [Utility room](/docs/plans/utility-room). There a bigger switch will be needed to connect everything. As all the access points will also be routed there, the switch could contain a PoE system, so we can phase out all the PoE adapters we currently have (4x for AP, 2x for the small switches).
