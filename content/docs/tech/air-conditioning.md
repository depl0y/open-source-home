# Air Conditioning

### Why
- Climate change causes hotter summers in the Netherlands
- Flat roof easier to heat up
- Solar panels will take care of the excessive energy usage

### Description
Air conditioning is a really power hungry, but with the summers in the Netherlands getting warmer and warmer, it would  be wise to at least make sure we account for air conditioning to be installed (now or in the future).

In our [plans](/docs/plans) we mentioned that we would like to have air conditioning in the following rooms:

- [Living room](/docs/plans/living-room)
- [Kitchen](/docs/plans/kitchen) (We are not sure air conditioning in a kitchen is feasible)
- [Office](/docs/plans/office)
- [Bedroom #1](/docs/plans/bedroom-1)
- [Bedroom #2](/docs/plans/bedroom-2)
- [Bedroom #3](/docs/plans/bedroom-3)

As we would install air conditioning during a build/renovation we could use ducts and cassette like solutions to integrate air conditioning as this would solve the need for a unit on the wall in each room/area.

Integration in [Home Assistant](/docs/tech/home-assistant) would be a plus, but as this system would not be permanently used for heating this isn't a hard requirement.

### Open questions
- [ ] Is this really needed? Can this problem be solved with good isolation and maybe the floor heating?
- [ ] Can preparations be done without installing air conditioning? (e.g. pre-install the piping)
