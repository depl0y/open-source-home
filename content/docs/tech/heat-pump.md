# Heat pump

### Why
- We don't want a gas connection (expensive and on it's way out).
- Pulling heat from the ground-source is really environment friendly
- Economically a great choice.
- Using an ground source heat-pump also means that we could cool the floor in the summers.
- Great combination with floor heating.

> This can fluctuate when use a really efficient heat pump, but these are average numbers I found.

### Open questions

- [ ] Do we use an ground source- or air heat-pump
