# Wood Stove

We love the wood stove we have currently, but with the stress wood stoves put on the environment and rules around stoves getting stricter, we are not sure this is the choice we want to make.

According to reports around **23%** of particulate matter in the air is sourced from wood stoves.

So these are the options:

- Wood stove, not using it as a main heat source
- Bio ethanol (cleaner fire, no output)
- Pellet stove

While the wood stove definitely has our vote for the way that it looks and feels, it also has the most negative side-effects.
