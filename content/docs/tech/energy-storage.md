# Energy storage

### Why
- We produce more power during the day, while we are not using that much at that time.
- Power companies saying that we produce too much solar power for the power lines to handle.

### Solutions
- Tesla Powerwall

### Open questions
- [ ] Is it possible to control where power is coming from?
- [ ] Can this be used intelligently, with predictions when batteries are full again?
- [ ] How much capacity do we need?
- [ ] Is off-grid something that is important? Power delivery is quite stable in the Netherlands.
