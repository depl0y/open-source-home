# Energy storage

### Why
- We produce more power during the day, while we are not using that much at that time.
- Power companies saying that we produce too much solar power for the power lines to handle.
- In the future energy companies will no longer pay enough for your energy, so your surplus will be less profitable (will no longer cancel out your usage).

### Open questions
* [ ] Is it possible to control where power is coming from?
* [ ] Can this be used intelligently, with predictions when batteries are full again?
* [ ] How much capacity do we need?
* [ ] What does battery degradation look like?
* [ ] Chaining of batteries seems like a good idea?
