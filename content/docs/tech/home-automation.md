# Home Automation

## Discussion
With the availability of Zigbee lights, power sockets, etc, is it really needed to have a fully controlled home automation system in the home. They usually do not work great with other systems like Home Assistant and expandability is expensive and cumbersome.

| PROS | CONS |
| --- | --- |
| Wired connections for everything enhances stability | Most do not integrate well with Home Assistant|
| Can be installed centrally in the house | A lot of dedicated wires to the utility room |
| | Only available when building new or completely renovating a house |
| | Usually not playing nice with other systems |
| | Semi-permanent when installing |
