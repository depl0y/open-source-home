# Kitchen appliances
This is mostly a estimate how much energy the default appliances in your kitchen use.

### Induction cooktop
This is the only choice if you want to be able to cook fast, with a lot of power, without using gas. Most of these use a maximum of 11kW, so this is something that needs to be taken in consideration.

If we take an average that we cook 300 days a year, for half an hour on 3 cooking zones, using half power. This would add up to **720 kWh** a year.

### Large refrigerator
We are currently using 2 refrigerators but we would like to go back to a single large one in the kitchen. We call these [american fridges](https://www.coolblue.nl/en/fridges/freestanding/american-fridges). Based on the averages mentioned on Coolblue, I estimate our usage at **420 kWh**.

### Ovens
In our current kitchen we both have a 90cm and a 60cm oven and we choose which one we want to use based on the size of the items. Large chicken or pizza usually ends up in the large oven, while stuff like bread gets put in the small one. This is a system I would like to use in our new kitchen as well.

**Large oven**  
I think we use the large oven maybe for 3 hours a month, on 80% of it's capacity (3.1kW). This results in a usage of **111 kWh**.

**Small oven**
The small oven is used way more frequent. I am guessing around 3 hours a week on (guess) 80% of it's capacity (3.6kW). This results in **561 kWh**.

### Range hood
We are not sure how we want this in our next kitchen, but usage numbers look on average all the same. They seem to have a capacity of around 150W and let's just say you run them around an hour each day (300 days a year). This would result in around **45 kWh**.
